    <h1>Square</h1>
    <p>All the colors and personalities<br>
      You can't see right through what I truly am<br>
      You're hurting me without noticing<br>
      I'm so, so broke like someone just robbed me<br><br>

      I'm no invincible<br>
      I have much memories of getting more weaker<br>
      I know I'm not loveable<br>
      But you know what you'd have to say<br><br>

      "Come on let's go to bed<br>
      We gonna rock the night away<br>
      Who did that to you, babe<br>
      If you're not in the right mood to sleep now then<br>
      Come on, let's drink and have very unmanageable day<br>
      Would you want me in bae<br>
      If you're not in the right mood to sleep now then<br>
      Come take my arms and go<br>
      I'II be yours for sure"<br><br>

      All the traces and reminiscences<br>
      You can't sense right through how I truly was<br>
      You were gripping me without noticing<br>
      Was so, so strange like someone never loved me<br><br>

      I'm no invincible<br>
      I have much memories of getting more weaker<br>
      I know I'm not loveable<br>
      But you know what you'd have to say<br><br>

      "Come on let's go to bed<br>
      We gonna rock the night away<br>
      Who did that to you, babe<br>
      If you're not in the right mood to sleep now then<br>
      Come on, let's drink and have very unmanageable day<br>
      Would you want me, in bae<br>
      If you're not in the right mood to sleep now then<br>
      Come take my arms and go<br>
      I'll be yours for sure"<br><br>

      You're the only one, who saw my yesterday<br>
      The one who knows I'm here alive today<br>
      Comfort me say, what I'm meant to you<br>
      You should know what you have to say<br><br>

      "Come on let's go to bed<br>
      We gonna rock the night away<br>
      Who did that to you, babe<br>
      If you're not in the right mood to sleep now then<br>
      Come on, let's drink and have very unmanageable day<br>
      Would you want me in, bae<br>
      If you're not in the right mood to sleep now then<br>
      Come, take my arms and go<br>
      I'll be yours for sure"</p><br>
